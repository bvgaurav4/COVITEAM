I'm enthusiastic about contributing my unique skill set to your project or team. My expertise spans custom YOLO v5 training, aimbot development, and inventive anti-cheat evasion techniques utilizing Arduino for precise mouse control , I've also designed a versatile game controller, but faced challenges adapting it due to varying Arduino board compatibility. To address this, I obtained a different Arduino board and successfully reconfigured the older one for flexibility.
Moreover, I'm actively working on a website to facilitate user collaboration by matching project team members. It employs a recommendation system, with Golang on the server and React on the client side. I'm dedicated to enhancing this project.
